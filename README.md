# Haskell
A file containing some Haskell exercises.

I like to use ghci

To run in ghci:

:l HaskellPractice.hs

What the functions do is commented in the code.

I have also included an example of using Java in a functional programming style i.e. no variables and side effects. This simple Java program counts the number of consonants and vowels in an input string. It works for strings that coinsist of lower-case letters [a-z].
